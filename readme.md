Before pushing to impraise is needed to compile the code.

1.  Install npm packages `npm install`
2.  Compile using gulp `gulp`

The `template` is squarespace repo which you can pull, from developer settings inside squarespace admin.
Whole compilation can be done better these days in only one repo.
